# Gaspi's Aseprite Scripts

Welcome to my collection of Aseprite Scripts. They all aim to save you time
doing specific and repetitive tasks. If you find yourself in this situation, you
can ask me for a commission! Contact below.

Please, take a look at the [repo wiki](https://github.com/PKGaspi/AsepriteScripts/wiki)
to learn more about the scripts.

## Disclaimer
These scripts were last tested on Aseprite version v1.3.8. It happened before that
an Aseprite update broke the functionality of these scripts. Please, backup your work 
before use. If a script doesn't work, please report openning an issue.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository.
1. In Aseprite, go to File -> Scripts -> Open Scripts Folder.
1. Copy the content of this repository's script folder into the opened script
   folder.
1. In Aseprite, go to File -> Scripts -> Re-scan Scripts Folder.

## Scripts

Here is a list with all the current scripts and how to use them:
- [Export Layers](https://github.com/PKGaspi/AsepriteScripts/wiki/Export-Layers)
- [Export Slices](https://github.com/PKGaspi/AsepriteScripts/wiki/Export-Slices)
- [Export Combinations](https://github.com/PKGaspi/AsepriteScripts/wiki/Export-Combinations)

Even if some options may look complicated, they are all set in a default value
so that they work straight away. If you're looking for more advanced and
specific ways of export, take a look at them.  

***Note***.- Some of the scripts
may mark the sprite as unsaved after executing. **NO** changes are made to the
sprite if it's not indicated by the script description. However, some of the
trickery involved causes the sprite to appear as modified.
